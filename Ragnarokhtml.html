            The Hunter, who spends a leisurely time hunting in the woods, travels to the world of adventure after answering calls by Tristan III, Lord of Rune-Midgards, for the recruitment of adventurers. Equipped with the ability to freely manipulate the bow, Hunters are able to hit moving targets even with eyes closed.
          </p>

          <p>
           By installing traps that generate various effects, Hunters possess the ability to interfere with the enemy's tactics and make a mess of their operations. Aimed shooting provides ranged support, but the Hunter also has the talent to attack enemies using their own falcon, which they became familiar with during their time in the forest. The falcon is able to attack enemies with great sharpness. It is a profession that has the excellent ability to cope with all weather conditions under any circumstances. The potential builds are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blitz Hunter Build</strong>: Focuses on high damage dps with a primary focus on the utilization of th falcion. This build is a fan favorite, simply due to the nature of how much damage it does while ignoring physical defense.
            </li>
            <li>
              <Strong>Double Strafe Build</strong>: This generic build focuses on the damage from double strafe, which is inevitably one of the most powerful pvm,mvp,and pvp skills in the game. This build primarily focuses on Dex to provide the most damage within a couple double strafes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trap Build</strong>: This is a very unique build that focuses on the hunters ability to use several different elementally charged traps. While it lacks the outright dps of other builds, it can provide for a unique hunter experience. This build is not to be underestimated.

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of not only the hunter class, but also the natural world of midgard.
            </li>
            <li>Decent knowedge of rune midgard equipment, monster types, and important cards in Ragnarok.</li>
            <li>
              A minimal amount of experience within the world of Ragnarok. As much as I want to hold your hand through this process, it is 2023, and by now, if you have not learned the basics of Ragnarok you are in quite a predicament.

            Hunters are undeniably one of the most powerful classes in the world of Rune Midgard. Not only do they have the ability of leveling quickly and dishing out quick amounts of DPS, they are one of the most versatile classes in the game.
          </p>

          <p1>
            In contrast to other classes, hunters have the ability to pretty much level wherever they want. Whether it's in a party exploring Biolabs, or going on a solo expedition deep within clocktower; they can literally do it all. 
          </p1>
          <p>
            In addition to having the versatility to level wherever they like, they are also a great hunting class (hehe ;) They level extremly quickly without the expense of spending large amounts of zeny on equips and cards. Many people will often roll a hunter class initially simply so they can generate funds for their primary class.

          <p>To get started, here is what your generic skill build should look like for a Blitz Hunter.</p>
          <code>
            <em>You may want to sacrifice one point from claymore trap to at least get a point into Detect. You may not be using it too often, however it's better than using Improve Concentration to unhide a monster.</em>
          </code>

          While this leveling guide is primarily for Blitz Hunters, it most certainly is not limited to them.As previously stated, hunters can level in many places, regardless of their build due to their versatility. Provided is a brief outline of where I enjoy leveling. I really try to avoid Geo's though simply because of how mundane they are to hunt.
        </p>
        <p1>
          <li><strong>Level 1-30: The Newb Stage</strong>
            <code>Payon Dungion/Rockers --> Mandragoras --> Mukas</code></li>
          <li><strong>Level 30-60: The Developing Stage</strong>
            <code>Smokies/Wormtails --> Floras --> Payon Dungion level 2 --> Geographers</code>
        <li><strong>Level 60-80: The "I'm A Hunter!" Stage</strong>
            <code>Geographers --> Argiopes --> Alligators --> Payon Dungion level 4 --> Clock Tower</code>
            <li><strong>Level 80-99:The Wow I am OP Stage</strong>
      <code>
Stings --> Chivalry 1/2 --> Turtle Dungion --> Magma Dungion --> Ice Dungion --> ANYWHERE REALLY AT THIS POINT ^__^</code>
        </p>
        <p1>
          The benefit of blitz hunters in later levels will allow them to quickly decimate mobs in these areas. The primary reason being that generally, these maps have mobs with very high defence and are very difficult for other classes to hunt.  
          </p1>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_Intelligence_Dillema">
        <header>The Intelligence Dillema</header>
        <article>
          <p>To get started, here is what your intelligence stat will look like for the blitz hunter.
          <code>
            Blitz damage for 99/50 Hunter with 5 Blitz Beat and 10 Steel Crow:26+4 INT: 960 (192x5)
56+4 INT: 1110 (222x5)
Basically every 1 INT = 5 total Blitz damage, because it hits 5 times.
5x30 = 150, so 30 INT is 150 more Blitz damage. 
          </code>
Intelligence may be useful along the way, but longer term builds will find more use from more points into Luck.

          <p>
            Final build (No gear, no buffs, no items other than Awakening Potion, includes standard Hunter skills, includes job bonuses):

AGI:
Multiple of 5, don't worry about ASPD with it. Every 5 AGI = 1 status defense. With no gear, and job bonuses/skills only, 88 base +17 = 105. Works well
          </p>
          <code>STR: 10+4 (3000 weight)
AGI: 88+17 (316 FLEE?, ASPD?)
VIT: 5+2 VIT (5070 HP, 26 HP regen)
INT: 26+4 INT (960, 192x5 Blitz, 527 SP, 11 SP regen)
DEX: 80+32 (416 HIT?)
LUK: 56+4 LUK (19% Falcon chance, 21 Crit)
</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes when using Agility.
          </p>

          <code>
            AGI:
Multiple of 5, don't worry about ASPD with it. Every 5 AGI = 1 status defense. With no gear, and job bonuses/skills only, 88 base +17 = 105. </code

            As mentioned previous, hunters benefit from their class early on simply because they do not require a large investment in gear to properly level or explore difficult map zones. Provided below is a basic build outlook, along with a recommended geared build set.
          </p>
          <img

alt="Hunter Build"/>
          <p>
            Consequently, you can choose a several different amount of gear sets for your final build, it really simply comes down to your stat distribution and what equips work best in getting you your needed bonuses.
          </p>

            So you've picked up your first bow and set of quivers. Now its time to get ready to shoot things, as thats what you'll end up doing best. Don't get discouraged, you're going to take a while to kill things for the first few levels. Once you break out of the 20's and make your
way to the 40's it gets faster and easier. There are several different ways to level, depending on the build you plan on playing as, so dont feel too stressed. Your OP after all!

          <p4 id="testing">
            As a reminder, dont forget to stack up on an excessive amount of arrows via quivers. It may be a bit costly, however it will save you a signifcant amount of time! The arrow quiver npc can be found in payon. Good Ole Jaax
